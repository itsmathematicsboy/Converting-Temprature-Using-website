Temperature Conversion Tool

Description

This project is a temperature conversion tool that allows users to convert temperature values between three commonly used temperature scales: **Celsius**, **Fahrenheit**, and **Kelvin**. Users can input a temperature in one scale and see the converted values in the other two scales.

This tool is useful for converting temperatures in various contexts, such as weather forecasting, scientific experiments, or everyday use.

Key Features

- Convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin
- Convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin
- Convert from Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit
- Responsive design** for use on various devices

Technologies Used

- HTML for the page structure
- CSS for styling and responsive layout
- JavaScript for temperature conversion logic and user interaction

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/temperature-conversion.git
   ```

2. **Open the `index.html` file in your browser** to start using the application.

3. **Use the application to convert temperatures** between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

## How the Application Works

1. Users input a temperature value in one scale (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin) into the provided input field.
2. Click the conversion button to calculate the temperature in the other two scales.
3. The converted results are displayed directly below the conversion button.

## Temperature Conversion

- **Celsius (째C)**: The most commonly used temperature scale in everyday life and science.
- **Fahrenheit (째F)**: Used in some countries, such as the United States. Water freezes at 32째F and boils at 212째F.
- **Kelvin (K)**: Used in physics and thermodynamics, starting at absolute zero (0K), where molecular motion ceases.
